        Distortion is typically considered to have a bad stigma surrounding it. To me it is also another factor in figuring out what works and what does not.
        The system errors cause for an interesting set of artistic style, while looking odd can have a purpose if thought out correctly.
        I see it as a method and just another way of expression that people don't seem to say out loud as someone who used to make alot of them for fun
        when I was younger, not so much now I can see why others are interested in it.
        I believe that it is just another language others prefer to use than what most are used to but it provides
        a layer of truth and what to look out for while at the same time, we see in most cases that it is clear what the subjects behind the source are.</p>

        <p> Aesthetic wise, it has honestly benefitted me more than anything else I would say. The amount of errors
            and mistakes I ended up going through only made me think harder which caused me to have a better personal understanding of what to do.
            I think the repitition, especially through the form of making a website has allowed me to think alot
            further than in most other cases. Some errors I personally went through just ended up making me go through hurdles,
            but in a way that I was able to find other forms of how things had functioned. For example, My link of the nasa site
            did not work on phoenix code but instead I had to take a bit more of my time to go through the
            browser version which ended up causing me to see other work arounds when it clearly works but with some
            form of glitch in my way of getting the work done.
