        <p>You are now in page 2 of my website where I discuss my experience with the class and how things have felt for me personally </p>
        
        
        <p>My current experience with the class could have started off better I'd say. 
        I was previously using krita until end of september before going to adobe which beforehand things
        were just a hassle. I think now I definitely have a clearer understanding and want to actively keep going.
        I am still not perfect at it but I have understood way better after making the jump in programs.</p>

        <p>My biggest misunderstandment so far was the pixel assignment. I think I could point that to
        the krita program and things just not making sense at the time. I think my aesthetic choices have
        been fine I don't much to say on those. following the step by step throughout this program wasn't too bad,
        aside from misunderstanding how to make a new page. Otherwise everything else was pretty simple to follow
        but I am sure something on my end was still most likely done incorrect but I will make the changes when told!</p>
