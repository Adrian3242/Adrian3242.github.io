        <p style="color: white; font: italic">Welcome to my portfolio, my work is based off my first year of doing intro to digital
        studio practice. I am currently still learning how to get better at web making but here
        will have my works based off what I have been assigned to do and the personal experience 
            I have had so far and what I've been able to accomplish, including a personal gif produced by me.</p>
